## About the Project

I have been participating in the Create with Code Live - Summer 2020 webinar series offered by Unity.
 
This was a simple project intended on teaching the ins and outs of the Unity game engine.

## What I Learned

This project not only introduced me to the Unity game engine, but it also allowed me to get a feel for the syntax of C# (which was much needed after working with Python for so long).

It is my goal to continue with the webinar series and create more complex games as I become more accustomed to Unit and C#.
